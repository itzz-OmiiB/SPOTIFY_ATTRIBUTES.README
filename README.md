Spotify is a digital music service that gives you access to millions of songs.

The Spotify Song Attributes Dataset is a comprehensive collection of music tracks, encompassing various genres and artist names. This dataset provides valuable insights into the world of music, allowing enthusiasts, researchers, and data scientists to delve into the characteristics and nuances of each track.

## EDA is performed by using following Python Libraries :-

1. numpy

2. pandas

3. matplotlib

4. seaborn


## FOLLOWING PLOTS ARE USED 

1. BARPLOT

2. REL PLOT

3. BOX PLOT

4. HEAT MAP




The dataset includes key features such as danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration, and time signature. These attributes provide a holistic view of the songs, enabling users to analyze and interpret different aspects of their musical composition.

OBSERVATIONS :-


-> First and the last five entries are displayed using head and tail.

-> The total number of attributes in this dataset is 22 and the total number of entries are 10080.

-> No duplicate column is found in the dataset.

-> Rows and Columns were transposed using transform() function.

-> After dropping the null values the number of entries reduces to 8580.

-> The above bar graph shows the energy of 5 particular tracks from the bottom of the dataset.

-> Top 10 popular songs are printed using query()function.

-> (Ijust) died in your arms is the longest song from the first 20 entries of the spotify dataset.

-> Correlation between speechiness and liveness is densly populated.

-> Outliers are present in the 'tepmo' attribute of the dataset.(normal rangeis from 40 to 205)

-> Rel plot shows the distribution of the data between 'loudness' and 'tempo' attributes on the dataset.

-> Correlation between the attributes and the heatmap is shown .
